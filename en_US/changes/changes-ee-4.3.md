## Version 4.3.8

*Release Date: 2022-04-01*

### Important changes

- For Docker images, the configuration directory `/opt/emqx/etc` has been removed from the VOLUME list, making it easier for users to rebuild images with changed configurations.
- CentOS 7 Erlang runtime rebuilt on OpenSSL-1.1.1n (previously 1.0), prior to v4.3.13, EMQX will fail to handshake and trigger `malformed_handshake_data` exception when clients use certain cipher suites.
- CentOS 8 Erlang runtime system rebuilt on RockyLinux 8. `centos8` will remain in the package name for backward compatibility.

### Enhancement

- Add Pulsar proxy support for rule engine bridging data to Pulsar.

- Add command line interface `emqx_ctl pem_cache clean` to allow forcibly clear x509 certificate cache to reload immediately after certificate file update.
- Refactored ExProto so that anonymous clients can also be displayed on Dashboard.
- Topic configuration items in bridges can now use `${node}` placeholders.
- Add validation of UTF-8 strings in MQTT packets in strict mode. When set to `true`, invalid UTF-8 strings will cause the client to disconnect.
- MQTT-SN gateway supports initiative to synchronize registered topics after session resumed.
- Improve the writing precision of rule engine floating point data from 10 decimal places to 17 decimal places.
- EMQX will prompt how to modify the initial password of Dashboard at startup.

## 4.3.7 Release

*Release Date: 2022-02-11*

### Important

A cluster-wide total connections calculation bug was fixed in in EMQX Enterprise 4.3.7. Previously only the individual node's local number of connections were checked against the max number of connections allowed by the license. After this fix, the total number of connections is aggregated cluster-wide every 5 seconds. An extra 10% overrun is allowed to compensate the delays in aggregation.

Users planning to upgrade should be aware of the possibility that this change may cause clients to reach the license limit and not be able to connect.

### Enhancement

- Support alarm about the usage rate of license connections. By default, the number of connections reaches 80% of the allowed number of licenses, and the alarm is raised. When it is less than 75%, the alarm is cleared. User can also customize in `emqx.conf`: `license.connection_high_watermark_alarm` , `license.connection_low_watermark_alarm`
- Support alarm about license expiration, when the validity period is less than 30 days, the alarm will be raised
- Rule engine supports the configuration of rules and actions for the event of abnormal loss of client messages to enhance the user's custom processing capabilities in this scenario
- Improve the relevant metrics during the execution of the rule engine SQL matching
- Fuzzy search on client supports special characters such as `*`, `(`, `)`
- Improve ACL-related metrics to solve the issue that the count does not increase due to hitting the ACL cache
- Added `connected_at` field to webhook event notifications
- Log client state before terminating client due to holding the lock too long

### Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that data import and export were not available in some cases
- The module update mechanism is improved to solve the issue that the module is unavailable after the update fails
