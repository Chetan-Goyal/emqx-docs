# Configuration Files

Users can configure EMQX with configuration files or environment variables. This chapter will introduce the EMQX configuration files. For configuration items and detailed introduction, see [Configuration Manual](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-docs/blob/release-5.0/en_US/configuration/configuration-manual.md).

## Configuration Files

### **Main Configuration File**

EMQX will create a group of directories after installation, among which, `etc` is the folder that keeps all the configuration files. This section will focus on the main configuration file: `emqx.conf`.

Depends on your installation mode, emqx.conf` is stored in:

| Installation                               | Path                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Installed with RPM or DEB package          | `/etc/emqx/emqx.conf`     |
| Running in docker container                | `/opt/emqx/etc/emqx.conf` |
| Extracted from portable compressed package | `./etc/emqx.conf`         |


As the main configuration file, `emqx.conf` contains most of the commonly used configuration items.
You can follow the example provided in the `emqx.conf.example` file (located within the same directory) to customize the settings.
EMQX uses the default settings if a config item is not found in the config files.

### Configuration Rewrite File

`emqx.conf` defines settings at a global level, for cases where you need to customize the settings for a cluster or a node,
EMQX also provides a configuration rewrite file implicitly overlaying `emqx.conf`:

**`cluster-override.conf`**

Contains configuration items for the entire cluster, configuration changes made from Dashboard, REST API, and CLI will be persisted to this file.

If a certain cluster node is restarted or some new nodes are added, the node will automatically copy and apply the configuration file from other nodes within the cluster, therefore there is no need nor recommended to configure it manually.

The configuration rewrite files are located in the `$data/configs/` directory, and the path of the `data` directory varies according to the installation method:

| Installation                               | Path                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Installed with RPM or DEB package          | `/var/lib/emqx`      |
| Running in docker container                | `/opt/emqx/data`     |
| Extracted from portable compressed package | `./data`             |

:::tip
It is possible to change data directory from config `node.data_dir` or environment variable `EMQX_NODE__DATA_DIR`,
however, when running a cluster, all nodes should have the same path.

By default, most global settings are defined in the `emqx.conf` file, if you perform certain operations on the cluster level with Dashboard, REST API or CLI, the changes will be synced with the `cluster-override.conf` as configuration files and overide the corresponding settings in `emqx.conf`. And this whole process is called hot reload.

For override rules, see [Configure override rules](#Configure override rules).

:::tip

Some configuration items cannot be overridden, for example, `node.name`.

## HOCON Configuration Format

Since EMQX 5.0, we have begun to use [Human-Optimized Config Object Notation (HOCON)](https://github.com/emqx/hocon) as the configuration file format.

HOCON is a format for human-readable data and a superset of JSON. With features like inheritance, combined, and quotes, HOCON further simplifies the configuration work.

**HOCON syntaxï¼š**

HOCON values can be represented as JSON-like objects, for example:

```
node {
  name = "emqx@127.0.0.1"
  cookie = "mysecret"
  cluster_call {
    retry_interval  =  1m
  }
}
```

or in flattening:

```
node.name = "127.0.0.1"
node.cookie = "mysecret"
node.cluster_call.retry_interval = "1m"
```

This cuttlefish-like flattening format is backward compatible with the previous EMQX versions, but it is used differently:

HOCON recommends adding quotes at both ends of the string. Strings without special characters can also be unquoted, for example `foo`, `foo_bar`, while cuttlefish regards all characters to the right of `=` as values.

For more information about HOCON syntax, please refer to [HOCON Documentation](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md).

## Environment Variables

Besides configuration files, you can also use environment variables to configure EMQX.

For example, environment variable `EMQX_NODE__NAME=emqx2@127.0.0.1` will override the following configuration:

```
# emqx.conf
node {
  name = "emqx@127.0.0.1"
}
```

Configuration items and environment variables can be converted by the following rules:

1. Since the `.` separator in the configuration file cannot be used in environment variables, EMQX uses double underscores `__` as the configuration separator;
2. To distinguish the converted configuration items from other environment variables, EMQX also adds a prefix `EMQX_` to the environment variable;
3. The value of the environment variable is parsed according to the HOCON value, making it possible to use the environment variable to pass the value of complex data types, but please note that special characters such as `:` and `=` need to be wrapped in double quotes `"`.

Conversion example:

```
# Environment variables

## localhost:1883 will be parsed into a struct `{"localhost": 1883}`, so it needs to be wrapped in double quotes
export EMQX_LISTENERS__SSL__DEFAULT__BIND='"127.0.0.1:8883"'

## Pass the HOCON array directly by character
export EMQX_LISTENERS__SSL__DEFAULT__AUTHENTICATION__SSL__CIPHERS='["TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"]'


# Configuration file
listeners.ssl.default {
  ...
  authentication {
    bind = "127.0.0.1:8883"
    ssl {
      ciphers = ["TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"]
    }
  }
}
```

::: tip

EMQX will ignore undefined root paths, for example, `EMQX_UNKNOWN_ROOT__FOOBAR` , because `UNKNOWN_ROOT` is not a pre-defined root path.

When a known root path is set with an unknown field name, EMQX will output a `warning` log at startup, for example, when `enable` is incorrectly configured as `enabled`, it will output:

```
[warning] unknown_env_vars: ["EMQX_AUTHENTICATION__ENABLED"]
```

:::

## Configure Override Rules

The value of HOCON will be overridden hierarchically, the rules are as follows:

- In the same file, the value defined in the later section will override any previous key value.
- A higher-level value will replace that of a lower-level.

### Override

In the following configuration, the `debug` value of `level` defined in the last line will overwrite the previously defined `error`, but the `enable` field remains unchanged:

```
log {
  console_handler{
    enable = true
    level = error
  }
}

## Set the console log printing level to debug, and keep the other configurations
log.console_handler.level = debug
```

The packet size limit was first set to 1MB, then overridden to 10MB:

```
zone {
  zone1 {
    mqtt.max_packet_size = 1M
  }
}
zone.zone1.mqtt.max_packet_size = 10M
```

### List Element Override

EMQX array has two expression ways:

- List, for example, `[1, 2, 3]`
- Map (subscribing), for example: `{"1"=1, "2"=2, "3"=3}`

The following 3 formats are equivalent:

```
authentication.1 = {...}
authentication = {"1": {...}}
authentication = [{...}]
```

Based on this feature, we can easily override the value of an element in an array, for example:

```
authentication  = [
  {
    enable = true,
    backend = "built_in_database",
    mechanism = "password_based"
  }
]

# The `enable` field of the first element can be overridden in the following way:
authentication.1.enable = false
```

::: tip

Arrays (in list format) will be fully overwritten and original value cannot be kept, for example:

```
authentication = [
  {
    enable = true
    backend = "built_in_database"
    mechanism="password_based"
  }
]

## With the following method, all fields except `enable` of the first element will be lost.
authentication = [{ enable = true }]
```

:::

## Schema

To make the HOCON objects type-safe, EMQX introduced a schema for it. The schema defines data types, and data fields' names and metadata for config value validation and more.

::: tip Tip The configuration document you are reading now is generated from schema metadata. :::

### Primitive Data Types

Complex types define data 'boxes' which may contain other complex data or primitive values. There are quite some different primitive types, to name a few:

- `atom()`.
- `boolean()`.
- `string()`.
- `integer()`.
- `float()`.
- `number()`.
- `binary()`, another format of string().
- `emqx_schema:duration()`, time duration, another format of integer()
- ...

::: tip Tip The primitive types are mostly self-describing, so there is usually not a lot to document. For types that are not so clear by their names, the field description is to be used to find the details. :::

### Complex Data Types

There are 4 complex data types in EMQX's HOCON config:

1. Struct: Named using an unquoted string, followed by a predefined list of fields. Only lowercase letters and digits are allowed in struct and field names. Also, only underscore can be used as a word separator.
2. Map: Map is like Struct, however the fields are not predefined.
3. Union: `MemberType1 | MemberType2 | ...`
4. Array: `[ElementType]`

::: tip Tip If map filed name is a positive integer number, it is interpreted as an alternative representation of an `Array`. For example:

```
myarray.1 = 74
myarray.2 = 75
```

will be interpreated as `myarray = [74, 75]`, which is handy when trying to override array elements. :::

### Config Paths

If we consider the whole EMQX config as a tree, to reference a primitive value, we can use a dot-separated names form string for the path from the tree-root (always a Struct) down to the primitive values at tree-leaves.

Each segment of the dotted string is a Struct filed name or Map key. For Array elements, 1-based index is used.

below are some examples

```
node.name = "emqx.127.0.0.1"
zone.zone1.max_packet_size = "10M"
authentication.1.enable = true
```

### TLS ciphers

Starting from v5.0.6, EMQX no longer pre-populates the ciphers list with a default set of cipher suite names. Instead, the default ciphers are applied at runtime when starting the listener for servers, or when establishing a TLS connection as a client.

Below are the default ciphers selected by EMQX.

For tlsv1.3:

```
ciphers =
  [ "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384", "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
    "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256", "TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256",
    "TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256"
  ]
```

For tlsv1.2 or earlier

```
ciphers =
  [ "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384",
    "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384",
    "ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "ECDH-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384",
    "ECDH-RSA-AES256-SHA384",
    "DHE-DSS-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA256",
    "AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "AES256-SHA256",
    "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256",
    "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256",
    "ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "ECDH-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256",
    "ECDH-RSA-AES128-SHA256",
    "DHE-DSS-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256",
    "AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "AES128-SHA256",
    "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA",
    "ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA",
    "DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA",
    "ECDH-ECDSA-AES256-SHA",
    "ECDH-RSA-AES256-SHA",
    "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA",
    "ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA",
    "DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA",
    "ECDH-ECDSA-AES128-SHA",
    "ECDH-RSA-AES128-SHA"
  ]
```

For PSK-enabled listeners

```
ciphers =
  [ "RSA-PSK-AES256-GCM-SHA384",
    "RSA-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA384",
    "RSA-PSK-AES128-GCM-SHA256",
    "RSA-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256",
    "RSA-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA",
    "RSA-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA"
  ]
```
