# Configuration

This chapter provides a detailed explanation on how to effectively adjust and optimize EMQX settings using configuration items and environment variables to meet the requirements of various business scenarios.

- In the [Configuration Item](./configuration.md) section, we present a comprehensive overview of the available configuration options in EMQX, including a detailed explanation of each option's description, type, default value, and possible values.
- The [Environment Variables](./environment-variable.md) section focuses on configuring EMQX using environment variables. By default, environment variables with the `EMQX_` prefix will override the settings in the configuration file.
