# Data Integration

Data integration is a channel used to connect EMQX and external data systems, for example, databases like MySQL, MongoDB, message brokers like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, or even an HTTP server.

Through data integration, users can send messages from EMQX to the external data system in real-time, or pull data from the external data system and send it to a topic in EMQX.

This chapter introduces the supported external data systems, how to set up the data bridge, how to create a rule for data forwarding, and how to test the data bridge and rules you just created.
